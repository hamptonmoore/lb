Recently I got fed up with HarpJS; it was having issues installing on my new systems and just never fully worked right.
That prompted me to go out on the search for a new static site generator.
I had already crossed out dynamic generators, like Wordpress.
They lack the mobility that static sites have and I have no desire to set up and maintain a database.
From past experiences, I also crossed out Jekyll and Hugo. I did not have good memories from when I tried to use them.
I decided I wanted something simple, expandable, and easy to use.

This is when I stumbled across a <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/my-public-blog-script-lb-is-now-much-improved.html">blog post</a> by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> about his <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb</a> blogging software.
I honestly do not even know if "software" is the right word to describe it, it's just an 80 line bash file.
I have used other things he has made in the past, with my current installing of Arch Linux on his LARBS dot file.
For its size, it was also surprisingly easy to use.
It was as easy as placing a few LB comments in a few HTML files.
Within a few minutes, I was up in running.
It also makes adding and publishes posts super easy with intuitive and easy commands.
With all of its benefits lb lacks in the expandability category for me because I am not great with complex shell scripts, but with time I am sure I will get there.
It is also quite a pain to rebuild already generated pages after the blog's theme changes, but that sounds like a good first project.
